I have been having problems with installing pandoc on my computer and problems with cloning repositories form github on my directories. My computer shows the message "illegal instruction 4" whenever I am trying to clone anything to git, so practically git does not work on my computer. Thus, I edited the markdown file on github.com and I used a different layout than the one proposed, due to no other alternative.
